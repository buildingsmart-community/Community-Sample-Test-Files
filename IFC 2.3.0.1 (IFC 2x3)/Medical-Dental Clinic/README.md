**Dataset Medcial-Dental Clinic**

Description:
A two story, clinic with a number of different department including medical, dental, pediatric, and imaging suites. This is a real building whose information has been redacted. In addition to the architectural model, discipline-specific models are created to simulate what might be created by engineering consultants on a much larger project. 

How can you best use this information?
The files provided here provide only a sample of the complete set of information that might be produced for a real project. This example can be used to demonstrate the relative size and complexity of Coordination MVD Files in STEP Physical File Format (SPFF). 

How did we use this information?
These files were used as the second common test models during "COBie Challenge" events held in the United States. In these trials software companies identified the information requried for their specific domains and use-cases, and then were tested in their ability to produce and/or consume the COBie data that would support those use cases. Data in COBie 2.4 Spreadsheet Physical File Format was tested directly. COBie data in "overloaded" Coordination MVD SPFF files was accomplished using the COBie Plugin for BIMserver, published by TNO. 

Where did this information come from?
The Medical-Dental Clinic project was provided to the US Construction Engineering Research Laboratory. These files were hosted by the US National Institute of Building Sciences from 2010 thru 2020, but were taken down without notice and so have been provided through the BSI repository.

How is this information liscenced?
These files were originally provided under Creative Commons Liscence. These files are provided here under this same liscence. Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0). You are free (1) to copy and resitribute this material any way you like, (2) you may change the information any way you want, (3) you must identify the source of the infomation as "BSI (2020) "Medical-Dental  Test Files," buildingSMART International" and add this GitHub URL, and (4) if you may changes to these files you must indicate the types of changes made.
