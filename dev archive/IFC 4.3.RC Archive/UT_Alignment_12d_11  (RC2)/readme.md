# UT_Alignment_12d_11
# An example where the vertical geometry (VG) starts after and ends before, the horizontal geometry (HG)
#
# Alignment with partial clothoid of decreasing radii between two left arcs, and vertical geometry
# There is a start chainage of 0.
# There is only the semantic definition and no ifc geometry 

### Intent

IFC 4x3 RC2
This scenario has a simple alignment consisting of a:
 Horizontal Geometry: left arc, partial clothoid of decreasting radii, left arc
 Vertical Geometry:   the vertical geometry starts after the HG
                      and stops before the end of the HG      
In the ifc file there is the seamantic definition of the alignment but no ifc geometry.

The Ifc file was generated by 12d Model - 4 January 2021 

### Prerequisites

This scenario builds upon the scenario UT_Alignment_12d_9

### Content

This scenario covers the additional concepts and/or IFC entities:

the vertical geometry starts after the HG and stops before the end of the HG
